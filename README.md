# Data_Visualization

In this project, I aim to visualize my personal expenditures from my first purchase to most recent, at sephora.com.

The methods for cleaning the data are specific to what was in the CSV file (e.g. multiple ",,,").

The methods used for visualizing the data are more general and can apply to any scatter plot.

A quick and simple first project!
